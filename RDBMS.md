# RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
An RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a type of database management system that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. It is based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables (also called relations). These tables are linked to each other through relationships, enabling efficient data retrieval and management.

## Key Features of RDBMS:
- **Tables (Relations):** Data is stored in tables, which consist of rows (records) and columns (attributes).
- **Primary Key:** Each table has a unique identifier (primary key) for each record.
- **Foreign Key:** Tables are related to each other using foreign keys, which establish relationships between tables.
- **ACID Properties:** RDBMS ensures data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** RDBMS uses SQL for querying, updating, and managing data.
- **Normalization:** Data is organized to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency through normalization.

## Examples of RDBMS:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite
